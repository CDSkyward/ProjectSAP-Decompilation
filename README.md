# How to build (CMake ðŸ¤‘ðŸ¤‘ðŸ¤‘)
## Get the source code

In order to clone the repository, you need to install Git, which you can get [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

Clone the repo **recursively**, using:
`git clone --recursive https://github.com/RSDKModding/RSDKv4-Decompilation`

If you've already cloned the repo, run this command inside of the repository:
```git submodule update --init --recursive```

## Getting dependencies

### Windows
To handle dependencies, you'll need to install [Visual Studio Community](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) (make sure to install the `Desktop development with C++` package during the installation) and [vcpkg](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/vcpkg/get_started/get-started?pivots=shell-cmd#1---set-up-vcpkg) (You only need to follow `1 - Set up vcpkg`).

After installing those, run the following in Command Prompt (make sure to replace `[vcpkg root]` with the path to the vcpkg installation!):
- `[vcpkg root]\vcpkg.exe install glew sdl2 libogg libvorbis --triplet=x64-windows-static` (If you're compiling a 32-bit build, replace `x64-windows-static` with `x86-windows-static`.)

Finally, follow the [compilation steps below](#compiling) using `-DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=[vcpkg root]/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake -DVCPKG_TARGET_TRIPLET=x64-windows-static -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=[vcpkg root]/installed/x64-windows-static/` as arguments for `cmake -B build`.
  - Make sure to replace each instance of `[vcpkg root]` with the path to the vcpkg installation!
  - If you're compiling a 32-bit build, replace each instance of `x64-windows-static` with `x86-windows-static`.

### Linux
Install the following dependencies: then follow the [compilation steps below](#compiling):
- **pacman (Arch):** `sudo pacman -S base-devel cmake glew sdl2 libogg libvorbis`
- **apt (Debian/Ubuntu):** `sudo apt install build-essential cmake libglew-dev libglfw3-dev libsdl2-dev libogg-dev libvorbis-dev`
- **rpm (Fedora):** `sudo dnf install make gcc cmake glew-devel glfw-devel sdl2-devel libogg-devel libvorbis-devel zlib-devel`
- **apk (Alpine/PostmarketOS)** `sudo apk add build-base cmake glew-dev glfw-dev sdl2-dev libogg-dev libvorbis-dev`
- Your favorite package manager here, [make a pull request](https://github.com/RSDKModding/RSDKv4-Decompilation/fork)

### Android
Follow the android build instructions [here.](./dependencies/android/README.md)

## Compiling

Compiling is as simple as typing the following in the root repository directory:
```
cmake -B build
cmake --build build --config release
```

The resulting build will be located somewhere in `build/` depending on your system.

The following cmake arguments are available when compiling:
- Use these by adding `-D[flag-name]=[value]` to the end of the `cmake -B build` command. For example, to build with `RETRO_DISABLE_PLUS` set to on, add `-RETRO_DISABLE_DEV=on` to the command.

### RSDKv4 flags (add a disable dev menu flag when compiling for distribution)
- `RETRO_DISABLE_DEV`: Disables the dev menu, only activate when distributing. Set to `off` by default.

# How to build (Stinky other compilers)
## Windows
* Clone the repo, then follow the instructions in the [depencencies readme for Windows](./dependencies/windows/dependencies.txt) to setup dependencies, then build via the visual studio solution.
* Alternatively, you can grab a prebuilt executable from the releases section.

## Windows via MSYS2 (64-bit Only)
* Download the newest version of the MSYS2 installer from [here](https://www.msys2.org/) and install it.
* Run the MINGW64 prompt (from the windows Start Menu/MSYS2 64-bit/MSYS2 MinGW 64-bit), when the program starts enter `pacman -Syuu` in the prompt and hit Enter.
* Press `Y` when it asks if you want to update packages. If it asks you to close the prompt, do so, then restart it and run the same command again. This updates the packages to their latest versions.
* Install the dependencies with the following command: `pacman -S pkg-config make git mingw-w64-i686-gcc mingw-w64-x86_64-gcc mingw-w64-x86_64-SDL2 mingw-w64-x86_64-libogg mingw-w64-x86_64-libvorbis mingw-w64-x86_64-glew`
* Clone the repo with the following command: `git clone --recursive https://github.com/Rubberduckycooly/Sonic-1-2-2013-Decompilation.git`
* Go into the repo you just cloned with `cd Sonic-1-2-2013-Decompilation`.
* Run `make -f Makefile.msys2 CXX=x86_64-w64-mingw32-g++ CXXFLAGS=-static -j4`.
  * -j switch is optional, but will make building faster by running it parallel on multiple cores (8 cores would be -j9).

## Windows UWP (Phone, Xbox, etc.)
* Clone the repo, then follow the instructions in the [depencencies readme for Windows](./dependencies/windows/dependencies.txt) and [depencencies readme for UWP](./dependencies/windows-uwp/dependencies.txt) to setup dependencies.
* Copy your `Data.rsdk` file into `Sonic1Decomp.UWP` or `Sonic2Decomp.UWP` depending on the game, then build and deploy via `RSDKv4.UWP.sln`.
* You may also need to generate visual assets. To do so, open the Package.appxmanifest file in the designer. Under the Visual Assets tab, select an image of your choice, and click generate.

## Linux
* To setup your build enviroment and library dependecies, run the following commands:
  * Ubuntu (Mint, Pop!_OS, etc...): `sudo apt install build-essential git libsdl2-dev libvorbis-dev libogg-dev libglew-dev libtheora-dev`
    * If you're using Debian, add `libgbm-dev` and `libdrm-dev`.
  * Arch Linux: `sudo pacman -S base-devel git sdl2 libvorbis libogg glew libtheora`
  * Clone the repo and its other dependencies with the following command: `git clone --recursive https://github.com/Rubberduckycooly/Sonic-1-2-2013-Decompilation.git`
  * Go into the repo you just cloned with `cd Sonic-1-2-2013-Decompilation`.
  * Run `make -j5`.
    * If your distro is using gcc 8.x.x, then add the argument `LIBS=-lstdc++fs`.
    * -j switch is optional, but will make building faster by running it parallel on multiple cores (8 cores would be -j9).

## Mac
* Clone the repo, follow the instructions in the [depencencies readme for Mac](./dependencies/mac/dependencies.txt) to setup dependencies, then build via the Xcode project.
* A Mac build of v1.3.0 by [Sappharad](https://github.com/Sappharad) can be found [here](https://github.com/Sappharad/Sonic-1-2-2013-Decompilation/releases/tag/1.3.0mac).

## Android
* Clone the repo, then follow the instructions in the [depencencies readme for Android](./dependencies/android/dependencies.txt).
* Ensure the symbolic links in `android/app/jni` are correct. If not, fix them with the following on Windows:
  * `mklink /D src ..\..\..`
  * `mklink /D SDL ..\..\..\dependencies\android\SDL`
* Open `android/` in Android Studio, install the NDK and everything else that it asks for, and build.
